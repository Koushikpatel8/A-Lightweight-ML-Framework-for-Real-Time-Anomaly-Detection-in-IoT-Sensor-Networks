# scripts/train_model.py
# This script trains a Random Forest model for IoT anomaly detection.
# It loads the dataset, encodes categorical features, splits data into train/test,
# trains the model, and finally saves the trained model and encoders for later use.

import pandas as pd
import os
import joblib
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Step 1: Load dataset
# The dataset is stored in the project data folder
data_path = "../data/Train_Test_Network_dataset/train_test_network.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(data_path)

# Step 2: Encode categorical features
# Categorical columns are transformed into numeric codes

for col in df.select_dtypes(include='object').columns:
    le = LabelEncoder()
    df[col] = le.fit_transform(df[col])

# Step 3: Split into features and labels
# Features (X) exclude the label column, target (y) is the label
X = df.drop('label', axis=1)
y = df['label']

# Step 4: Train/test split
# The dataset is split 80/20 for training and testing
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 5: Train the model
# Random Forest is chosen for its robustness and ensemble learning approach
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 6: Save model and encoders
# The trained model and encoders are saved to the models directory
